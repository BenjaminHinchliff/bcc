# bcc (Benjamin's C Compiler)

Wow. It's a C compiler. Look how creative this person is. I bet no one has done this before. Anyway, I've always wanted to create a compiler for a full blown
statically typed programming language, so I've decided to do this.

It's still *very much* a work in progress, but since it's to the point where I've got most of the architecture down for the Lexer, Parser, and Codegen,
now it's just a matter of adding features. Oh and typing might need some reorganization. Anyway, I'll get to that. Take a look at the [tests][1] to see what
it can do right now (not much).
